# Contributing to Bourdon

Bourdon is source-available under the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL) and in pre-alpha. Free for solo developers, internal/non-competing commercial use, research, and education; auto-converts to Apache 2.0 four years after each version is published. See [`LICENSE_FAQ.md`](LICENSE_FAQ.md) for plain-English guidance. Contributions welcome — especially adapters for agents and frameworks not yet covered.

## Current Status

v0.0.1 scaffold. Phase 1 reference orchestrator (L0 + L1) is working standalone. Federation layer (L5 + L6) and adapter plugin system are under active design.

**If you want to build on this today, expect sharp edges.** The spec is likely to change between v0.0.x and v0.1.x as we learn from the reference implementation.

## Where to Start

- **Read the thesis.** [`spec/THESIS.md`](spec/THESIS.md) explains *why* the architecture looks the way it does. If you disagree with the thesis, your contribution may end up pulling in the wrong direction.
- **Read the architecture.** [`spec/ARCHITECTURE_v0.1.md`](spec/ARCHITECTURE_v0.1.md) is the full layer-by-layer description.
- **See use cases.** [`spec/USE_CASES.md`](spec/USE_CASES.md) shows the intended breadth — dev tools are the proving ground, but the architecture targets universal knowledge work.
- **Check the contributor list.** [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) lists maintainers and AI co-implementors with their branch lanes (`cursor/*`, `claude/*`, `codex/*`). If you're submitting agent-assisted work, follow the agent-as-author convention documented there.

## Types of Contributions

### Adapters (most wanted)
Bourdon's value scales linearly with the number of agents/tools it can federate. An adapter reads a native agent's memory store and emits a normalized L5 manifest. See [`adapters/`](adapters/) for examples (once implemented) and the adapter contract spec in `spec/ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md` (coming in v0.1.0).

Specifically wanted:
- Cursor adapter (SQLite schema reverse-engineering) — v0 in progress at [`ryandavispro1-cmyk/cursor-spot`](https://github.com/ryandavispro1-cmyk/cursor-spot); will upstream once stable.
- Copilot adapter (accepting the encrypted-reasoning limitation)
- LangChain / CrewAI / AutoGen memory exporters
- Non-agent data sources: Linear, Attio, Notion, Google Calendar, Slack, email (IMAP/MBOX), Obsidian

### Core improvements
- L0 keyword detection is currently naive string matching. Fuzzy matching + alias tables would be a straight win.
- L1 token budget enforcement currently drops entities in iteration order. LRU or relevance-weighted eviction would be better.
- Async timing model testing — we need property tests that verify L2 never blocks first-response generation.

### Documentation
- Worked tutorials per domain (one of the USE_CASES scenarios as an end-to-end walkthrough)
- Adapter authoring guide
- Architecture diagram improvements

### Research
- How do we measure "recognition vs. lookup" feel? The subjective 8+/10 metric is a start — we need better eval methodology.
- What happens to memory at scale (year-active agent with 1000+ entities)? Rollup strategies need research.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbourdon/bourdon
cd bourdon

# Python 3.10+ required
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Hybrid Memory Cycle Workflow

For contributors working on L5/L6 federation and retrieval ergonomics, use the memory-cycle scripts:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bootstrap-bourdon-mcp.ps1 -WorkspaceRoot "."
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run_memory_cycle.ps1 -WorkspaceRoot "." -SchemaPath ".\spec\L5_schema.json"
```

This run validates:

- short-index merge and workspace-over-global precedence
- L5 export correctness
- MCP tool availability + smoke assertions
- machine-readable report output under `.cursor/memory/reports/`

Running the smoke test:
```bash
cd core/
python orchestrator.py
```

## Filing Issues

Before filing:
- Check if it's already captured in `spec/ROADMAP.md` (coming soon) or existing issues
- If it's an adapter request, consider building it — adapters are the easiest contribution path
- If it's a philosophy/scope question, `spec/THESIS.md` is the canonical reference

## Commit Style

Conventional commits preferred: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. If something needs formalizing later we will, but for now: assume good faith, disagree productively, don't be a jerk.
