# 🎶 Continuo — Release Notes

### Your AI agents finally remember each other.

> *Named for basso continuo — the continuous bass line in Baroque music that holds everything together while the melody soars above it.*

Every AI tool you use — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot — builds its own silo of memory. **None of them talk to each other.** You repeat yourself. Context evaporates. Collaboration resets to zero every time you switch tools.

**Continuo fixes that.** A tiered, timing-aware memory protocol that federates knowledge across every agent you work with — so your tools recognize you, recognize your projects, and recognize *each other*.

This isn't retrieval-augmented generation. This is **recognition-augmented cognition.** Your AI doesn't look you up. It *knows* you.

## 🚀 v0.0.12 — Layer C: KV-Cache-Aware Interrupts

**Released 2026-05-03** · 343 unit + 5 live integration tests passing · MIT licensed · [continuo.cloud](https://continuo.cloud) live

### What's New

🔁 **`RecognitionResult.recommended_slot_id`.** New optional field on the result object. For `interrupt_first` dispatches, this is populated with `slot_to_cancel` so the caller knows which slot the next `stream_completion` should run on. Pass it forward and llama-server's `cache_prompt: true` automatically reuses whatever prefix the new prompt shares with the cancelled one — avoiding a full prompt re-encode. `recognition_first` leaves the field `None` (no in-flight slot in the speaker-just-started case).

🧬 **`build_splice_prompt(cancelled_prompt, cancelled_partial, new_user_msg, *, template=None)`.** Composes a continuation prompt that threads the interrupted context into the new turn. Default template puts the cancelled prompt + partial generation on top, an `[Interrupted at this point. New request: ...]` separator, then the new request. Custom format strings supported. The model sees the interruption narratively rather than as a hard reset — useful when the cancelled generation was producing signal the new turn should be aware of.

🎛️ **Two valid interrupt strategies, now both first-class.** Hard reset (`new_user_msg` only) was the implicit default; **splice** (cancelled context + new request) is now a one-function-call option. Both flow through the same `recommended_slot_id` so KV-cache reuse applies regardless.

🧪 **348 tests passing** (was 340 at v0.0.11) — 8 new test cases for `recommended_slot_id` semantics and `build_splice_prompt` template behavior, including empty-partial / empty-prior-prompt / None-arg defensive paths.

### Authorship

- **Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context)** designed and implemented Layer C; the API shape (additive optional field + free-standing helper) was chosen so callers can adopt incrementally.

## 📦 The Story So Far

Twelve releases. Six in one day (the foundational architecture), then the recognition-first runtime, the backend-neutral inference layer, end-to-end validation + Layer B, the Cursor adapter graduation, token-based recognition, and Layer C:

### v0.0.11 — Token-Based Recognition

Recognition matching switched from substring to **token-based**: both user message and entity candidate are tokenized into alphanumeric runs; the candidate must appear as a contiguous token subsequence. Fixes "ba**NAS**"-matches-"NAS" type false-positives caught live during dogfood. Multi-word entities still match across punctuation; aliases handle shorter forms when intended. **340 tests passing.**

### v0.0.10 — Cursor Adapter Graduates from cursor-spot

**The deferred-from-day-1 Cursor adapter ships.** `adapters/cursor.py` reads Cursor's SQLite `state.vscdb` files at the platform-specific data directory, copies read-only to a tmp file before parsing, and emits a normalized Continuo L5 manifest. Cursor agent-as-author preserved on the SQLite extraction (`_cursor_sqlite.py`). All four headline IDE adapters (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, native Clyde/Clair) are now in tree. CONTRIBUTORS.md gains a stacked-PR cursor[bot] caveat. **335 tests passing.**

### v0.0.9 — Layer A Validated + Layer B (`interrupt_first`)

**Layer A goes from theoretical to measured.** New `tests/integration/test_llama_cpp_live.py` exercises the adapter against an actual running `llama-server`; cancel-mid-stream actually stops generation within budget. **Layer B / `interrupt_first`** is the symmetric speaker-still-talking primitive — mid-stream interrupt + new recognition + restart, with KV-cache reuse coming free from the underlying backend. Adapter gains another `httpx` exception (`StreamClosed`) in the cancel-aware clause (Cursor agent-as-author). Headline measurement on real hardware: recognition emitted in 0.0ms; Gemma 27B Q6_K's first token at ~1000ms; recognition runs a full second ahead. **323 tests passing.**

### v0.0.8 — Backend-Neutral Inference Layer (Layer A)

**The contract that makes Continuo's runtime backend-agnostic.** `core/inference_protocol.py` defines `InferenceBackend` as a `@runtime_checkable Protocol` with four methods: `capabilities()`, `slots()`, `stream_completion()`, `cancel()`. `adapters/llama_cpp_backend.py` implements it against `llama-server` SSE — first concrete adapter; httpx is gated behind the `[llama-cpp]` extra so the Protocol surface stays dependency-free. `register_backend()` checks capability requirements at registration time so missing primitives raise `BackendUnsupported` loudly rather than silently degrading. First release to formally exercise the agent-as-author + agent-as-reviewer pattern: Claude authored, Cursor reviewed and hardened. **310 tests passing.**

### v0.0.7 — Recognition Runtime + Temporal Validity + Role Narratives

**The headline behavior fix.** `core/recognition_runtime.py` ships the first concrete implementation of the recognition-first runtime: synchronous template-based recognition string + concurrent L1 hydration awaitable, ≤3s timeout budget, never raises. Plus `agent.role_narrative` (differentiates agents sharing the same `type` slug — Inspired by [Intrinsic Memory Agents](https://hf.co/papers/2508.08997)). Plus temporal validity windows on entities (Zep-Graphiti-inspired `valid_from`/`valid_to`). Plus `continuo codex export | build-context | eval` and `continuo claude-code export` SessionEnd hook target. Plus `spec/POSITIONING.md` and `spec/RELATED_WORK.md`. **250 tests passing.** Deployed at [continuo.cloud](https://continuo.cloud).

### v0.0.6 — Codex Adapter + Atomic L5 Write

**OpenAI Codex joins the federation, and L5 writes are never observed half-written.** `adapters/codex.py` parses `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl` newest-first, resolves rollout files to extract working directories and timestamps, and dedupes thread names into topic entities. Registered under the `continuo.adapters` entry point. `core/l5_io.py` introduces `write_l5()` / `write_l5_dict()` with tmp + rename atomic semantics — safe on POSIX and NTFS, no more race conditions between adapters writing and L6 reading. **188 tests passing.**

### v0.0.5 — L6 Federation MCP Server *(the big one)*

**The layer that makes it all real.** `core/l6_store.py` loads every agent's L5 manifest from `~/agent-library/agents/`, builds a cross-agent entity index, and exposes four query primitives — `list_agents`, `find_entity`, `list_recent_work`, `get_cross_agent_summary` — with visibility filtering re-applied at query time. `core/l6_server.py` wraps the store in a `fastmcp` MCP server. Launch with `python -m core.l6_server` and any MCP client can query the combined memory of every agent you've ever used. **149 tests passing.**

### v0.0.4 — L2 UltraRAG Async Integration

**Memory retrieval that doesn't make you wait.** L2 fires concurrently with the AI's first response and completes while you're still reading. It *never* blocks. It *never* raises. If the retrieval backend is down, you still get a response — you just don't get the deep context. Opt in via `CONTINUO_L2_ENABLED=true` or `core/l2_config.yaml`. **116 tests passing.**

### v0.0.3 — Claude Code Adapter Full Parsing

**Your Claude Code brain, federated.** Parses `PROJECTS/*/OVERVIEW.md` → project entities, `LOG/*.md` → sessions, auto-memory frontmatter → entities, and `memory.jsonl` knowledge graph → entities. Person-type entities and credential patterns are automatically marked `PRIVATE` — zero secrets leak into federation. Entity dedupe across all sources with priority ordering and merge rules. Tested against a real Claude Code brain: 55 entities, 46 sessions, 0 credential leaks. **80 tests passing.**

### v0.0.2 — L5 Schema + Adapter Contract + CI

**The spec that holds everything together.** `spec/L5_schema.json` defines the normative JSON Schema for L5 manifests. `spec/ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md` defines the rules every adapter must follow. `adapters/base.py` provides the Protocol, dataclasses, and visibility helpers. CI matrix: Ubuntu + Windows + macOS × Python 3.10–3.12. **49 tests passing.**

### v0.0.1 — Initial Scaffold

**Where it started.** Phase 1 orchestrator with L0 hot cache and L1 entity synopses. The spec documents that define *why* this architecture exists. The proof that timing-aware memory feels fundamentally different from retrieval-based memory.

## 🏗️ The Memory Stack

```
Per-agent personal memory:
  L0 — Hot Cache          always in prompt, instant recognition (~3K tokens)
  L1 — Entity Synopses    triggered on keyword hit, parallel loaded
  L2 — Episodic Memory    async retrieval during human response time
  L3 — Indexed History    on-demand searchable session logs
  L4 — Raw Archive        verbatim conversation history

Cross-agent federation:
  L5 — Agent Manifest     per-agent public glossary (projection of L0–L4)
  L6 — Federation Library  aggregates all L5s, exposed as MCP server
```

**L0–L2 are implemented. L5–L6 are implemented. The federation loop is closed.**

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python ≥ 3.10** — that's it for core
- `pyyaml >= 6.0` — the only hard dependency
- `fastmcp >= 2.0` — optional, for L2 UltraRAG or L6 server

> ⚠️ **Pre-Alpha (v0.0.12).** Not production-ready — but the architecture is real, 348 tests pass, the federation loop works end-to-end, the recognition-first runtime is implemented (with both `recognition_first` and `interrupt_first` primitives, token-boundary entity matching, and a `build_splice_prompt` helper for narrative continuation across interrupts), the inference layer it drives is backend-neutral and KV-cache-reuse-aware, the timing thesis is proven as measured behavior on real hardware (recognition emitted in 0ms; the model's first token a full second behind), and the four headline IDE adapters (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, native Clyde/Clair) are all in tree. Built in the open as a spec-and-reference-implementation for a convention we hope the ecosystem adopts.
