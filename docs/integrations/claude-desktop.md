# Bourdon × Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is Anthropic's MCP host with the simplest setup story: a single JSON config file, no plugin marketplace, no per-workspace surface. That makes it the lowest-friction reader for cross-agent federation. **If you only wire one MCP host, wire this one** — it's the demo described in [`docs/PROOF.md`](../PROOF.md).

Claude Desktop is a **reader**. It doesn't write its own L5 manifests yet (no Claude Desktop adapter ships in Bourdon as of v0.4.1). You federate other agents' content *into* Claude Desktop.

## What this gives you

Once configured, the Bourdon tools become callable from any Claude Desktop conversation. Ask the model anything that needs cross-session or cross-agent memory and it'll call into Bourdon transparently. Concrete queries that work after a single `bourdon claude-code export`:

- *"What projects has Claude Code touched this week?"*
- *"Find everything across my agents that mentions <project name>."*
- *"What was the most recent session focused on <topic>?"*

The full tool inventory matches the OpenManus integration; see the table in [`docs/integrations/openmanus.md`](openmanus.md#why-this-works) for what each tool does. Same server, same surface.

## Prerequisites

1. **Bourdon installed in a Python environment Claude Desktop can launch.** `pip install 'bourdon[server]'` in the global Python is the simplest path. If you use a venv, you'll need the absolute path to the venv's `bourdon` binary in the config — see "PATH gotcha" below.
2. **At least one L5 manifest.** Run `bourdon claude-code export` once to seed `~/agent-library/agents/claude-code.l5.yaml`. Verify with `bourdon serve` — the banner should show `agents: 1 loaded`.
3. **Claude Desktop installed and at least once-launched** so its config directory exists.

## The config

Locate Claude Desktop's MCP config file:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (path may vary; check Claude Desktop's docs)

If the file doesn't exist, create it. Add a `bourdon` entry under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bourdon": {
      "command": "bourdon",
      "args": ["serve", "--quiet"]
    }
  }
}
```

If Claude Desktop already had other MCP servers configured, just add the `bourdon` key alongside them — don't replace the whole object.

Restart Claude Desktop. The Bourdon tools should appear in the model's tool list.

## PATH gotcha

Claude Desktop launches MCP servers as subprocesses with a minimal PATH — often just system defaults, not your interactive shell's PATH. If `bourdon` lives in a venv, the bare `"command": "bourdon"` won't resolve and the MCP server will silently fail to start.

Symptom: Bourdon tools never appear in the conversation, no obvious error, and Claude Desktop's MCP log says something like `command not found` or the server process exits immediately.

Fix: use the absolute path.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bourdon": {
      "command": "/Users/you/path/to/.venv/bin/bourdon",
      "args": ["serve", "--quiet"]
    }
  }
}
```

To find the right path: `which bourdon` in the shell where you ran `pip install bourdon`.

## Custom library path

If your `agent-library/` lives somewhere other than `~/agent-library/` (rare, but the `bourdon serve --library` flag supports it):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bourdon": {
      "command": "bourdon",
      "args": ["serve", "--quiet", "--library", "/path/to/agent-library"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Visibility (the access-level question)

Three of five adapters tag entities as `team` visibility by default (Codex always, Copilot and Cursor by policy). Bourdon's L6 tools default to `access_level="public"`, which **filters those entities out**. For a single-user federation where you trust your own agents, you want `team`.

There are two ways to handle this from Claude Desktop:

1. **Ask the model to pass the access level explicitly.** Most calls accept an `access_level` parameter. Phrase queries like *"Call `list_recent_work` with `access_level='team'`."*
2. **Wait for v0.5.0**, which is expected to add a config flag that flips the L6 default to `team` for single-user installs. Tracked in claude-brain Finding 2.

The second is friendlier but isn't shipped yet.

## Verifying it works

The full diagnostic flow:

```
# 1. Verify Bourdon can see at least one manifest.
bourdon serve --quiet
# Expect: "agents: N loaded (claude-code, ...)"
# Ctrl-C to stop.

# 2. Verify the round-trip works on real data (without Claude Desktop in the loop).
bourdon dogfood
# Expect: PASS for any plantable adapter you have set up.

# 3. In Claude Desktop, ask:
"Call the Bourdon MCP tool `list_recent_work` with `access_level='team'` and show me the raw result."
# Expect: a structured response with sessions from your federated agents.

# 4. If step 3 works but natural-language queries don't, the model isn't choosing
# to invoke Bourdon. That's a prompting / instructions issue, not an integration
# issue. Add a system prompt fragment like:
#   "When the user asks about past work or cross-agent context, call the
#   Bourdon MCP tools (`list_recent_work`, `find_entity`, etc.)."
```

## Known limitations

- **No write side yet.** Claude Desktop doesn't have a Bourdon adapter; it can't *contribute* to the federation, only read from it. If you want what happens in Claude Desktop sessions to be part of the federation, you'd need to either (a) wait for a future Claude Desktop adapter or (b) manually summarize and feed back into another agent's store.
- **No automatic refresh.** The L6 server reads `~/agent-library/` on startup. New manifests written *while* Claude Desktop has the MCP server running won't show up until you restart Claude Desktop. (Future: file-watching in `L6Store`, tracked but not scheduled.)
- **Subprocess lifecycle quirks.** If Claude Desktop's MCP subprocess management gets confused, the Bourdon server can end up in a half-attached state. `pkill -f "core.l6_server"` clears it; restarting Claude Desktop respawns cleanly.
