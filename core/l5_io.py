"""
Bourdon L5 I/O -- atomic write + read helpers for L5 manifests.

Writing is done via tmp-file + atomic rename so readers (e.g., the L6Store
file watcher in future versions) never observe a half-written manifest.
On POSIX and on Windows/NTFS, ``Path.replace`` is atomic within the same
filesystem, so this pattern is safe for the common case of writing into
``~/agent-library/agents/`` on local disk.

Minimal surface -- most of the heavy lifting lives in callers (adapters
build L5Manifest objects; the L6 server reads them back through L6Store).
This module is only the boundary between in-memory and on-disk form.
