"""
Continuo inference backend protocol -- the contract every local-inference
adapter must implement.

This module is deliberately backend-neutral. It exists because the
recognition-first runtime (``core/recognition_runtime.py``) needs to drive
token streaming concurrent with hydration, and a future interrupt-first
primitive will need mid-stream cancel and concurrent slot routing.
Today only llama.cpp's ``llama-server`` supports the full capability set;
Ollama and ``transformers`` cannot. Hard-coding llama.cpp into the runtime
would make every other backend a second-class citizen forever, even after
they catch up. This Protocol prevents that.

Adapters live under ``adapters/`` and implement this contract. Callers
(``recognition_runtime``, future ``interrupt_runtime``, user orchestrators)
import only from here -- never from ``adapters/``. The capability surface
is checked at registration time, so a backend that does not support a
required primitive fails loudly with a structured error -- it never
silently degrades.

Example registration::

    from core.inference_protocol import register_backend

    backend = MyAdapter()  # implements InferenceBackend
    register_backend(backend, required_capabilities={"streaming", "cancel"})

See ``spec/RELATED_WORK.md`` for how this contract relates to other
inference-server APIs (llama.cpp slots, vLLM continuous batching,
TGI sequence groups).

        Backend-specific identifier for the cached prompt prefix on
        this slot. Used by future routing logic to prefer slots that
        already have a useful KV cache. None when the backend does
        not expose this information.

    lifetime of the backend instance -- if a backend's capabilities
    change at runtime (a model is unloaded, slots are reconfigured),
    it should construct a new instance rather than mutate this struct.

    Capability semantics
    --------------------
    streaming
        ``stream_completion`` yields tokens incrementally. Required for
        any Continuo use -- recognition-first depends on model response
        streaming concurrent with L1 hydration.
    cancel
        ``cancel(slot_id)`` actually stops generation on the named slot.
        Required for the future ``interrupt_first`` primitive. Backends
        that can only stop by closing the SSE connection should still
        report ``cancel=True`` and implement that path in ``cancel()``.
    concurrent_slots
        Number of slots that can run simultaneously. 1 means serialized;
        >1 means a new request can begin while another is mid-generation.
    kv_cache_reuse
        ``stream_completion(slot_id=...)`` honours the slot's cached
        prompt prefix when the new prompt is a continuation of the
        previous one. Enables the splice case for ``interrupt_first``
        without restarting from scratch.
