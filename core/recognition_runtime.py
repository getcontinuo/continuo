"""
Continuo recognition-first runtime.

Emits an immediate recognition response from the L0 / known-entities surface
and concurrently kicks off L1 hydration. The recognition string is computed
synchronously with no I/O and no model call -- it's a template populated from
matched-entity metadata, by deliberate design (see the project's POSITIONING.md
for the thesis grounding). This keeps L0 honest to its architectural role: the
recognition layer is *recognition*, not abbreviated retrieval.

Caller pattern (for an LLM-streaming context):

    result = recognition_first(user_msg, manifest, l1_dir=l1_dir)

    # 1. Emit the recognition immediately (no retrieval has happened yet)
    await stream.send(result.recognition)

    # 2. Start generating the model's main response in parallel with
    #    awaiting hydration:
    detail_future = asyncio.create_task(result.hydration) if result.hydration else None
    async for token in model.stream(user_msg, system_prompt=...):
        await stream.send(token)

    # 3. Inject hydrated detail when available (next turn or appended):
    if detail_future is not None:
        try:
            detail = await detail_future
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            detail = ""
        if detail:
            await stream.send_system_context(detail)

The recognition layer NEVER blocks on retrieval. Hydration NEVER blocks the
first response. Hydration NEVER raises -- timeouts and errors yield empty
string so the worst case degrades to "L0-only response" cleanly.

Future replacement for the template-based recognition string is straight-
forward: swap `build_recognition_string` for an LLM-based generator without
changing the public API. The Protocol-shaped boundary makes the swap safe.

    Cancel an in-flight generation and return a fresh recognition for a new
    user message.

    Symmetric companion to :func:`recognition_first` for the
    speaker-still-talking case: the model is mid-generation on
    ``slot_to_cancel`` and a new user message arrives. This primitive:

      1. Cancels the in-flight generation on ``slot_to_cancel``
         (best-effort, idempotent, never raises -- per the
         ``InferenceBackend.cancel`` contract).
      2. Computes recognition for the new message synchronously.
      3. Sets up the parallel hydration awaitable for the new message.

    The returned :class:`RecognitionResult` has the same shape as
    ``recognition_first``'s, so the caller's downstream pattern is
    identical: emit the recognition string, start a fresh
    ``stream_completion`` for the new message, await hydration in
    parallel.

    KV-cache reuse: when the backend supports it (e.g. ``llama-server``
    with ``cache_prompt: true``, which the bundled
    ``LlamaCppBackend`` enables by default), the next
    ``stream_completion`` call on the same slot will automatically reuse
    any cached prefix that overlaps with the new prompt. No special
    handling is required here; just pass ``slot_id=slot_to_cancel`` to
    the next ``stream_completion`` call.

    Why this is its own primitive rather than ``await backend.cancel(...);
    return recognition_first(...)`` at the call site:

      * **Names the operation.** "Interrupt first" is a first-class
        primitive in the timing thesis, symmetric to "recognition first."
        Downstream code expresses intent.
      * **Locks the cancel-then-recognize order.** Recognizing first then
        cancelling adds milliseconds to the recognition emit; that's the
        entire latency budget the thesis is built on. This wrapper makes
        the right order the only order.
      * **Provides a place to evolve sophistication.** Layer C may add
        KV-cache splice (continue the slot's prompt rather than restart),
        prompt merging (acknowledge the interrupted thread), or history
        threading. Caller code that uses this primitive will not change
        when those land.

    Parameters
    ----------
    new_user_msg
        The interrupting message.
    manifest
        L5 manifest (same shape as :func:`recognition_first`).
