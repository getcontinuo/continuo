# Contributors

Bourdon is built by humans working with AI co-implementors. The contributor list documents who is authorized to push and what their lane is, so the project stays legible as more agents come online.

## Maintainers

- **Ryan Davis** -- RADLAB LLC. Project lead, thesis author, merges PRs, sets direction.

## AI co-implementors

Bourdon is co-built with AI agents working alongside their humans. The convention is **agent-as-author**: the commit lands under the human's GitHub identity (so attribution and code-review responsibility stay with a real person), and the PR description names the agent and links to the originating session for traceability.

If you submit a PR that an AI agent helped write, please:

1. Include the agent name and a link to the session (e.g. `cursor.com/agents/...`, `claude.ai/code/session_...`) in the PR description.
2. Push from a branch in your agent's lane (see below) so reviewers can tell at a glance what's happening.
3. State which parts you reviewed yourself -- the human is responsible for what the PR claims.

### Cursor Cloud Agent -- `cursor-cloud-agent`

- **Status:** contributor (granted 2026-05-02)
- **Branch lane:** `cursor/<feature-slug>`
- **Scope:** Cursor adapter (SQLite reverse engineering -- see CONTRIBUTING.md "Specifically wanted"), Cursor-side recognition wiring, Cursor integration docs.
- **Staging area:** `ryandavispro1-cmyk/cursor-spot` hosts v0 of the Cursor-Bourdon CLI and SQLite adapter while it's stabilized; mature pieces are upstreamed here as PRs.
- **Notes:** Cursor Cloud commits land under the human's GitHub identity. PRs from Cursor link the originating Cursor session.

### Claude Code -- `claude` / `claude-code-bot`

- **Status:** contributor (granted 2026-05-02)
- **Branch lane:** `claude/<feature-slug>`
- **Scope:** core orchestrator, L0/L1 logic, federation (L5/L6), spec, tests, contributor docs, repo maintenance.

### Codex -- `codex`

- **Status:** contributor (granted 2026-05-02)
- **Branch lane:** `codex/<feature-slug>`
- **Scope:** co-implementor on the reference orchestrator and CLI. Documented as co-author in earlier work; formal lane added so future Codex sessions have a documented home.
- **Recent delivery (OpenAI Codex 5.3):** hybrid memory cycle tooling, MCP smoke assertions, CI/report automation, and starter template packaging.

## Stacked-PR caveat (cursor[bot] auto-close)

When an agent (Cursor especially) opens a PR whose **base branch is another open PR's head branch** (a stacked PR), automation may auto-close the child PR when the parent merges -- even if the child contains commits the parent did not absorb. We hit this on 2026-05-03: PR #14 merged at `T+0`, and `cursor[bot]` closed PR #12 at `T+3 seconds` and deleted its head ref at `T+5 seconds`. Four hardening commits unique to the child became unreachable from any branch.

Recovery is possible if you fetched recently (`git cat-file -e <sha>` confirms the SHA is still in your local object store; cherry-pick onto a fresh branch off `main`). But the recovery window is finite -- once garbage collection runs, the orphaned commits are gone.

**To avoid this entirely:**

- **Prefer non-stacked PRs.** Open the child against `main` directly with the parent's branch as a *base reference in the PR description*, rather than as the literal git base.
- If you must stack, **squash the parent into the child branch before merging the parent**, so the child's diff against `main` is empty when the auto-close fires.
- After merging a parent PR, **immediately verify any open child PRs** still target a valid branch and contain the expected diff.

This entry exists because future agents working in stacked configurations need to know about the foot-gun before they hit it.

## Adding a new agent

1. Add a section above with: name, branch lane, scope, identity-on-commits.
2. If the agent's runtime needs specific git config (sandbox `user.name`, token scopes, push permissions), capture the working configuration so the next agent doesn't have to rediscover it.
3. Open a PR. Maintainers approve agent additions because the lane is also a write-access decision.
